The data generated by the framework is segmented into chirps where each chirp has a length defined by the number of samples. The final data stream is then merged into a vector comprising all chirps and is shown in Figure 1.

    Figure 1. ViRa data stream structure.

This data stream is further published as a rostopic */raw_data* of type *std_msgs/Float64MultiArray* for processing at the host side.
When multiple antennas are used, the receiver signals are concatenated.
